Sleepmode: 
### . **How It Works**

1. **Active State**:
    
    - The sensor reads ambient light data and transmits it via UART.
    - The LED (`LD3_Pin`) is turned on to indicate the active state.
2. **Sleep State**:
    
    - The `LTR329_Sleep` function puts the sensor into standby mode.
    - The LED is turned off to indicate the sleep state.
    - The system waits for 5 seconds (or your preferred duration).
3. **Wake-Up State**:
    
    - The `LTR329_WakeUp` function sets the sensor back to active mode.
    - A delay is added after wake-up to allow the sensor to stabilize before the next reading.

according to datasheet: 
standby current: 5 $micro$A
initial startup: 100 ms
waking up: 10 ms
