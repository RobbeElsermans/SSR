Please, in order to convert a generated .ioc file of STM32, use the virtual environment by

```
pwd = /SSR/STM32
source /venv/bin/activate
```

```
pip install stm2pio
python3 -m pip install -U platformio
```
use **stm32pio init** to generate the platformio project from an .ioc file generated by CubeMX.
```
stm32 init
```
add the device name in the .ini file e.i. **nucleo_l412kb**
```
stm32 generate
```
Please note that teh error about GPDSC, doesn't matter
See -> https://github.com/ussserrr/stm32pio/issues/114

In order to regenerate the changed .ioc through cubeMX and link it to platformio
```
stm32 patch
```

and to deactivate the env
```
deactivate
```

For advanced stuff like MiddleWare applications such as FreeRTOS or any other thing, not done yet.
