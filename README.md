Simple Stupid Rover

A school project where we developed a mars rover that has to be power efficient to last long on harvested energy.

This in combination with low power communication where we use BLE for inter robot communication and LoRa to send out some sensor readings to be monitored on a dashboard.

We use temperature sensor for the environment temperature as wel as an Gyroscope to detect any anomalies when standing still or driving the rover (e.g. bumps, pits).

Lastly, energy awareness is an important key stone of our system as it relies on harvested energy.
